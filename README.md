[ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is a Kubernetes add-on for automatically managing DNS records for Kubernetes ingresses and services by using different DNS providers. This webhook provider allows you to automate DNS records from your Kubernetes clusters into your MikroTik router.

Supported DNS record types: `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS`, `SRV`, `TXT`

For examples of creating DNS records either via CRDs or via Ingress/Service annotations, check out the [`example/` directory](./example/).

## üéØ Requirements

> [!Note]
> `v0.15.0` of ExternalDNS added support for `providerSpecific` annotations in Ingress/Service objects for webhook providers.
>
> While older versions of ExternalDNS may work, but support for this feature will not be present.

- ExternalDNS >= `v0.15.0`
- Mikrotik RouterOS (tested on `7.16` stable)

## üö´ Limitations

### Multiple `Targets`

Currently, `DNSEndpoints` with multiple `targets` are **not** supported. No error will be thrown, but only one record will be created with the first target from the list.

This means that when creating a `DNSEndpoint` like this, only the first of the two targets will be taken into account (i.e. `192.192.192.192`).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: externaldns.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: DNSEndpoint
metadata:
  name: a-record
spec:
  endpoints:
    - dnsName: a.example.com
      recordTTL: 3605
      recordType: A
      targets:
        - 192.192.192.192
        - 193.193.193.193

```

The problem is that the External DNS controller will detect a drift on this and it will continuously attempt to update the DNS record, thus it will constantly send `PUT` requests to your RouterOS instance on every reconciliation loop.

### Webhook Server Configuration

## üöÄ Deployment

1. Create a service account in RouterOS. This local user needs read and write access to manage static DNS.
2. Create a Kubernetes namespace for your External DNS deployment

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: external-dns
    ```

3. Create a Kubernetes secret with the connection details for your RouterOS instance:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: mikrotik-credentials
      namespace: external-dns
    stringData:
      MIKROTIK_BASEURL: "https://192.168.88.1:443"
      MIKROTIK_USERNAME: "external-dns"
      MIKROTIK_PASSWORD: "external-dns"
      MIKROTIK_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY: "true"
    ```

4. Add the External DNS helm repository and update your local cache

    ```bash
    helm repo add external-dns https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/
    helm repo update
    ```

5. Configure your helm values. Take a look at the [example values.yaml](./example/values.yaml)
6. Install the External DNS helm chart

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install --namespace external-dns external-dns external-dns/external-dns -f values.yaml
    ```

> [!TIP]
> By default, support for MX, NS and SRV records is disabled and needs to be enabled via the `--managed-record-types` argument.
> Make sure to set `--managed-record-types=SRV` if you want to enable SRV records, and so on.
